# Job-Portal
🎯 JobHub – Job Portal
📌 Overview

JobHub is a React-based job portal where job seekers can browse and apply for jobs, while recruiters can add or remove job postings.
The app uses a mock API for sample jobs and localStorage for persistence.

✨ Features

🔎 Search & Filter jobs by title or company

📅 Sort jobs by newest or oldest

👀 Detailed Job View with description and apply option

📝 Recruiter Mode: Add new jobs and delete existing ones

💾 LocalStorage Persistence (jobs & applications saved locally)

🎨 Modern UI with responsive layout

🛠️ Tech Stack

⚛️ React 18 (CDN + Babel)

🌐 HTML5 & CSS3

💾 LocalStorage

🖥️ Mock API: jsonfakery.com/jobs

📂 Project Structure
job-portal/
│── index.html   # Entry point, loads React + Babel
│── style.css    # Custom styling
│── app.js       # React app logic
│── README.md    # Project documentation

⚙️ How It Works

On page load, jobs are fetched from the mock API and combined with locally saved jobs.

Users can switch roles (Job Seeker / Recruiter) from the header.

Recruiters → Add jobs via form or delete jobs.

Seekers → Search, filter, view details, and apply for jobs.

All applications and recruiter-added jobs are stored in localStorage.

📌 Future Improvements

🔑 Authentication (separate dashboards for recruiters & seekers)

🗄️ Backend integration (replace localStorage with a real database)

💾 Save favorite jobs

🛠️ Advanced filtering (location, remote, salary, etc.)
