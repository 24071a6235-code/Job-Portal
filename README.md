# Job-Portal
# 🎯 JobHub 

## 📌 Overview
**JobHub** is a React-based job portal where job seekers can browse and apply for jobs, while recruiters can add or remove job postings.  
The app uses a **mock API** for sample jobs and **localStorage** for persistence.

## ⚙️ How It Works
- On page load, **jobs are fetched** from the mock API and combined with locally saved jobs.  
- Users can **switch roles** (Job Seeker / Recruiter) from the header.  
- **Recruiters** → Add jobs via form or delete jobs.  
- **Seekers** → Search, filter, view details, and apply for jobs.  
- All applications and recruiter-added jobs are stored in **localStorage**.

## 📌 Future Improvements
- 🔑 **Authentication** – Separate dashboards for recruiters & seekers  
- 🗄️ **Backend Integration** – Replace localStorage with a real database  
- 💾 **Save Favorite Jobs**  
- 🛠️ **Advanced Filtering** – Location, remote, salary, etc.
